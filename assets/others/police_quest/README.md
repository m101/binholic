These are exploits for the Police Quest challenge by TheColonial.

- poc_ubuntu.py : This was tested on Ubuntu 18.04
- poc_docker.py : Works on the docker target running on a Ubuntu 18.04 host.
The docker runs under Debian 8.11 (Jessie)
- poc_targetless.py : It works for both ubuntu 18.04 and docker.
This was not tested on another Linux distribution.
Reliability has not been impacted, it's been verified by running the exploit
1000-2000 times.
