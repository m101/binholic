        VACANCY DESCRIPTION</span></div>
<br>
<strong>Cyber Security Specialist - GC10</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Senior Cyber Security Specialist - GC9</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
GCHQ is at the forefront of the nation's cyber security strategy and is 
dedicated to ensuring our government can operate in cyber space with 
confidence. We are committed to staying ahead of the swift pace demanded
 by the evolving digital world.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
In a game where our adversaries operate with no rules and unknown 
boundary lines, you will be exploring the possibilities and inventing 
the seemingly impossible. We need pioneers that can push the technical 
boundaries and cope with the unknown. Our work involves a journey to the
 very depths of operating systems, complex networks and IT security 
fundamentals.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p></p><br><div class="header">
    <span class="general_bold">
        REQUIREMENTS</span></div>
<br>
We are looking for high calibre, enthusiastic and innovative individuals
 with strong technical skills. You need to be good at problem solving, 
delivering at pace and have the ability to work as part of a team.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Graduate Level</strong>: We are looking for graduates with a 
minimum 2:1 degree in a STEM related subject (Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics), preferably with a significant IT 
component.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Experienced</strong>: We are looking for people with 
specialist knowledge, professional qualifications and/or practical 
experience gained in a formal or informal setting.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Please ensure if you are an existing Civil Servant&nbsp;or have 
been involved in Government work in any capacity&nbsp;that the responses
 on your application and the content within your CV remains at an 
Unclassified level.</strong> </div>
<p></p><br><div class="header">
    <span class="general_bold">
        RESPONSIBILITIES</span></div>
<br>
Successful candidates will be engaged in a wide variety of roles where 
their problem solving skills will be key. The roles are across a number 
of areas within GCHQ's cyber mission, this is due to the wide remit we 
have to assist in the protection and defence of HMG and the Critical 
National Infrastructure. This remit includes the protection of 
government IT systems, carrying out research and development, 
discovering new threats, providing forensic, malware and intrusion 
analysis as well as being an expert in the wide variety of technologies 
used in the cyber world today and in the future.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
We are not just looking for good people, we are looking for people who 
are, or have the potential to become, experts in their field. You will 
be using your technical expertise to pioneer solutions to complex 
problems, rather than just delivering to specification and as a result, 
you will often need to combine&nbsp;your technical skills with an 
enquiring mind. 
<p></p><br><div class="header">
    <span class="general_bold">
        ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</span></div>
<br>
<strong>Salary</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
The starting salary for the GC10 position is £25,446.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
The starting salary for the GC9 position is £31,152.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
GCHQ reserves the right to assess candidates at both grades.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Your salary will be based upon working a 5 day week of 42 hours, 
including lunch intervals of 1 hour (37 hours net). A system of flexible
 working hours is in operation in most areas, dependant on business 
needs. Where available, this allows individuals to vary the times they 
start and finish work each day, enabling them to take up to 4 days 
additional leave ('flexi') per 4-week period.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
GCHQ operates a non-consolidated performance related payment scheme 
which enables&nbsp;staff achieving prescribed levels of performance to 
attract the payment of a non-consolidated performance payment. Salary is
 paid in arrears by monthly transfer. Salary scales are reviewed 
annually in October.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Annual Leave</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
New entrants to GCHQ are given a basic holiday entitlement (otherwise 
known as 'leave') of 22 days per year, rising to 25 days after one years
 service.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
After 10 years service your leave entitlement will rise to 30 days per 
year. GCHQ is flexible in the accrual of leave, enabling staff to carry 
over or anticipate annual leave from one year to another.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
In addition, there are 10.5 days for public and privilege holidays.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Pension</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
When you join GCHQ you are eligible to join the Civil Service pension arrangements. We offer two types of pension:
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
    <li>NUVOS - This is an occupational pension scheme that currently 
has a 3.5% member contribution rate. As your employer we meet the rest 
of the cost of the scheme. <br>
    <br>
    
    </li><li>PARTNERSHIP PENSION ACCOUNT - This is a stakeholder pension
 with a contribution from your employer. How much we pay is based on 
your age. We pay this regardless of whether you choose to contribute 
anything. You do not have to contribute, but if you do, we will also 
match your contributions up to 3% of your pensionable earnings. The 
contributions are in addition to the age-related contribution mentioned 
above. </li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>The Application Process</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
NOTE: Application is On-line only. You are encouraged to complete the 
application form thoroughly, as an invitation to the next stage is based
 on this information. We cannot, unfortunately, pursue those applicants 
who do not provide all the relevant information on the application form.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Please also ensure you maintain your 'Main Details' section with any 
changes to your contact details -especially your email address - as this
 will be our main method of communicating with you.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Fully completed applications are then subject to the processes described
 in the Selection Process section below. Candidate expenses may be 
payable to candidates attending an Assessment Centre or Interview.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Candidate Expenses</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Applicants attending an Assessment Centre&nbsp;will have their 
qualifying UK incurred expenses paid, subject to a maximum 55 GBP for 
justifiable overnight accommodation, standard rail fares only or basic 
mileage allowance (15 pence per mile) if travelling by car. Details of 
how to claim will be provided by staff when you attend your assessment 
centre or interview. GCHQ does not pay claims for testing events.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>YOUR PUBLIC PROFILE</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
GCHQ is an organisation that has secrets of crucial importance to the 
security, defence and economic wellbeing of the UK. Foreign Intelligence
 Services are active in this country and are targeting these secrets. 
They are interested in members of the security or intelligence agencies 
and, in particular, those at the start of their career.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
To protect yourself and the UK&#8217;s secrets, don&#8217;t take everyone at face 
value. Be particularly wary of anyone who shows undue interest in your 
future job plans; think about the security aspects of what you do. For 
example, be mindful of how you present yourself on the internet - do not
 post on social networking sites that you have applied to GCHQ! Think 
twice before you tell anyone where you may be going to work! <a href="https://www.onboard-gchq.co.uk/docs/Your.pdf">Click here</a> to read further about how you should manage your public profile.

    <span class="general_bold">
        SELECTION PROCESS</span></div>
<br>
<strong>Application</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Application is on-line only; Closing date for the campaign is&nbsp;<strong>12&nbsp;December</strong> <strong>2011</strong>.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Paper Sift </strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
The initial paper sift of completed applications will be conducted by 
the Recruitment team to ensure applicants meet the minimum criteria and 
the nationality/residency requirements. (This sift also takes into 
account candidates who have declared a disability and who meet the 
minimum criteria).
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Tests</strong>
<div></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Candidates successful at the sift stage will be invited to sit ability tests. Tests will be held&nbsp;in <strong>Manchester on&nbsp;10 January 2012 and in Cheltenham&nbsp;on 14&nbsp;January 2012&nbsp;</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Assessment Centre</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Applicants successful at the test stage will be invited to attend an 
assessment centre at GCHQ. The assessment centres are scheduled for <strong>20 Feb to 09 Mar 2012</strong>.
 As part of the normal selection and vetting process you will also talk 
to a Vetting Officer and you will be required to take a drugs test at 
this time.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Note: Applicants who are selected to attend an Assessment Centre and 
will be expected to bring with them their Degree or Professional 
Qualification Certificates as detailed in the minimum entry requirements
 above. Applicants awaiting qualification results must provide evidence 
of their result before a formal offer of appointment can be made.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Your invite to attend an Assessment Centre will also contain guidance on
 how to obtain a Credit Check Reference Agency Report. Please bring your
 report to the Assessment Centre stage as this will help to speed up the
 Background Enquiry Process should you be successful.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Background Enquiry Process</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
If successful, you will progress to the next stage of the recruitment 
process where we enquire into nationality, health, security and other 
matters. A formal offer of appointment cannot be made until these 
enquiries have been satisfactorily completed. This stage takes, on 
average, 3 - 5 months (but can be longer).
<div>&nbsp;</div>
GCHQ operates a strict policy on the use of illegal drugs and the misuse or abuse of legal drugs.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Contacting Your Employer</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
As part of the background enquiry process and before the granting of any
 security clearance can be&nbsp;considered, a representative from our 
Personnel Security will need to contact your current employer. This is 
normally towards the end of the background enquiry process after your 
consent to contact them has been sought.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Joining</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Upon successful completion of background enquiries, candidates will be 
given a formal job offer. The Recruitment Team will call or email you to
 arrange a mutually convenient date to start work at GCHQ and will issue
 the relevant paperwork. All new entrants begin their careers by 
attending an induction course (run monthly).
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Deployment</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
The roles available in the department are wide and varied. GCHQ will aim
 to identify people to work in specific areas from the very first stages
 of the recruitment process. Therefore you will need to ensure you 
answer all questions as honestly and comprehensively as you can. Every 
stage of the recruitment process is aimed at identifying the skills and 
competencies that GCHQ can best use. This could mean that you have a 
preference for one particular area of work but GCHQ places you in 
another. This is in recognition of the fact that GCHQ has identified you
 have aptitude in skills that match to other business areas needs. 
Therefore, your first posting is likely to be for a minimum of 3 years, 
in line with the departmental standard; after this you will be able to 
express a preference for subsequent roles.
